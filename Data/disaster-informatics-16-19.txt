TI  - Historical Earthquakes and Their Socioeconomic Consequences in China: 1950–2017.
LID - 2728
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal pattern of historical earthquake disasters and
      resultant socioeconomic consequences is essential for designing effective
      disaster risk reduction measures. Based on historical earthquake disaster
      records, this study compiles a Chinese earthquake disaster catalog (CH-CAT) that 
      includes records of 722 earthquake disasters that occurred during 1950–2017 in
      the mainland of China. This catalog includes more complete data records than
      other existing global earthquake databases for China as a whole. Statistical
      results demonstrate that the number of earthquake disasters and the resultant
      direct economic losses (DELs) exhibit significant increasing trends (p < 0.01)
      over the studied 68-year period. Earthquake-induced deaths vary greatly between
      individual years and exhibit no significant trend. The Qinghai-Tibet seismic zone
      is the area with the highest frequency of earthquake disasters and the largest
      accumulated DELs, whereas the North China seismic zone is associated with the
      highest number of deaths. Among the 722 earthquake disasters, nearly 99.0% of
      deaths and 95.0% of DELs are attributable to 1.8% and 3.9% of the earthquake
      disasters, respectively. Approximately 54.2% of recorded earthquake disasters
      have earthquake magnitude (Ms) values between 5.0 and 5.9, while earthquake
      disasters with Ms greater than or equal to 7.0 account for 88.5% of DELs and
      98.8% of deaths. On average, earthquake-induced DELs and deaths increase
      nonlinearly with increasing Ms per earthquake. DELs have a positive correlation
      with deaths and casualties on a logarithmic scale. This study further discusses
      that during different stages of socioeconomic development, changes in both
      exposure and vulnerability may be the major factors leading to change differences
      in earthquake-induced socioeconomic consequences. This study is a beneficial
      supplement to the global earthquake database and is useful for calibrating global
      or regional empirical loss models.

TI  - The importance of education on disasters and emergencies: A review article.
LID - 85
AB  - Disasters and emergencies have been increasing all over the world. Todays, with
      technological advancement, acquiring knowledge and its application in the realm
      of action is regarded as the only effective way for prevent disasters or reducing
      its effects. The present study aimed to review the importance of education and
      the effect of different methods of education on disaster risk reduction and
      preparedness in vulnerable people. To this aim, some articles indexed in Database
      of PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, Science Direct, and ProQuest
      were searched. The search was limited to reviewed articles in English published
      between 1990 and 2017. In addition, the selected articles were reviewed for
      relevant citations. The conducted studies were reviewed by two researchers
      independently. The primary search generated 128 relevant references. After
      eliminating the duplicates and articles which were not related to the review of
      the abstract, 41 references were identified for inclusion. After reviewing more, 
      31 references, which failed to meet inclusion index, were excluded from the
      study. Disaster education aims to provide knowledge among individuals and groups 
      to take actions to reduce their vulnerability to disasters. During the last
      decades, the issue that trained people can be prepared for disasters and
      responding well has been extensively investigated. Based on the results, disaster
      education is a functional, operational, and cost-effective tool for risk
      management. Based on some evidence, it is important for vulnerable people to
      learn about disasters. There are different methods to educate vulnerable people, 
      but no method is better than others. Trained people can better protect themselves
      and others. In this regard, planning and designing comprehensive educational
      programs are necessary for people to face disasters.

TI  - Evaluation of an Agricultural Meteorological Disaster Based on Multiple Criterion
      Decision Making and Evolutionary Algorithm.
LID - 612
AB  - The evaluation of a meteorological disaster can be regarded as a
      multiple-criteria decision making problem because it involves many indexes.
      Firstly, a comprehensive indexing system for an agricultural meteorological
      disaster is proposed, which includes the disaster rate, the inundated rate, and
      the complete loss rate. Following this, the relative weights of the three
      criteria are acquired using a novel proposed evolutionary algorithm. The proposed
      algorithm consists of a differential evolution algorithm and an evolution
      strategy. Finally, a novel evaluation model, based on the proposed algorithm and 
      the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS),
      is presented to estimate the agricultural meteorological disaster of 2008 in
      China. The geographic information system (GIS) technique is employed to depict
      the disaster. The experimental results demonstrated that the agricultural
      meteorological disaster of 2008 was very serious, especially in Hunan and Hubei
      provinces. Some useful suggestions are provided to relieve agriculture
      meteorological disasters.

TI  - The design and psychometric evaluation of the Adolescents' Resilience in Disaster
      Tool (ARDT-Q37): A mixed method study.
LID - e02019
AB  - Adolescent resilience after a disaster has been shown to be a protective factor
      against loss, trauma, and psychological distress. Its importance for successful
      disaster recovery is widely accepted by disaster risk management professionals,
      yet very few tools are available to assess adolescent resilience during an
      emergency or after a natural disaster has occurred. The aim of this study was to 
      develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a questionnaire designed to
      measure adolescents' resilience before, during or after a natural disaster. This 
      mixed method study was carried out in three phases involving item generation,
      systematic review (phase one), qualitative analysis (phase two) and the reduction
      of items (phase three). The psychometric evaluation of the Adolescents'
      Resilience in Disaster Tool (ARDT) was conducted using the data from 599 high
      school students North of Iran (Golestan Province). The initial item pool included
      80 items that were reduced to 37 after assessment of validity (face, content and 
      structure) and reliability. Exploratory Factor Analysis found five factors that
      affect adolescents' resilience which included helping, trusting in God and
      hopefulness, adaptability, self-confidence and social support. The internal
      consistency was desirable (α = .86 and ICC = .91; 95% CI: .849 to .948). The
      psychometric support for the 37-item version of the ARDT in this study indicates 
      strong support for the ARDT-Q37 as a rapid assessment tool to evaluate resilience
      in adolescents aged 12–18 years old. Identifying the status of adolescents’
      resilience and determining their level of need for intervention during and after 
      a natural disaster is critical for long- and short-term outcomes. Implications
      for policy makers and professionals involved in the preparedness, response and
      recovery from natural disasters are discussed.

TI  - Rehabilitation of vulnerable groups in emergencies and disasters: A systematic
      review.
PG  - 253-63
AB  - BACKGROUND:: Natural and man-made disasters, especially those occurring in large 
      scales not only result in human mortality, but also cause physical,
      psychological, and social disabilities. Providing effective rehabilitation
      services in time can decrease the frequency of such disabilities. The aim of the 
      current study was to perform a systematic review related to rehabilitation of
      vulnerable groups in emergencies and disasters. METHODS:: The systematic review
      was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews
      and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The key words “recovery”,
      “rehabilitation”, “reconstruction”, “transformation”, “transition”, “emergency”, 
      “disaster”, “crisis”, “hazard”, “catastrophe”, “tragedy”, “mass casualty
      incident”, “women”, “female”, “children”, “pediatric”, “disable”, “handicap”,
      “elder”, “old” and “vulnerable” were used in combination with Boolean operators
      OR and AND. ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Ovid, ProQuest,
      Wiley, Google Scholar were searched. RESULTS:: In this study a total of 11 928
      articles were considered and 25 articles were selected for final review of
      rehabilitation of vulnerable groups based on the objective of this study.
      Twenty-five studies including six qualitative, sixteen cross-sectional and three 
      randomized controlled trials were reviewed for rehabilitation of vulnerable
      groups in emergencies and disasters. Out of the selected papers, 23 were studied 
      based on rehabilitation after natural disasters and the remaining were man-made
      disasters. Most types of rehabilitation were physical, social, psychological and 
      economic. CONCLUSION:: The review of the papers showed different programs of
      physical, physiological, economic and social rehabilitations for vulnerable
      groups after emergencies and disasters. It may help health field managers better 
      implement standard rehabilitation activities for vulnerable groups.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of postdisaster major depression: convergence of
      evidence from 11 disaster studies using consistent methods.
PG  - 96-101
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine predictors of postdisaster major
      depression in two separate datasets of survivors of various disasters.
      Postdisaster major depression was examined in two disaster databases using
      consistent research methodology, permitting combination of databases into a
      combined dataset including 1,181 survivors of 11 disasters representing all major
      disaster typologies with full diagnostic assessment using structured diagnostic
      interviews from two databases. The first database includes 808 directly-exposed
      survivors of 10 disasters. The second includes 373 survivors of the September 11,
      2001 attacks on New York City’s World Trade Center, recruited from employees of
      eight organizations affected by the disaster. This rich dataset permitted
      comparison of predictors of postdisaster major depression between databases and
      across survivors of different disasters. Identical models applied to both
      databases found postdisaster major depression to be independently associated with
      pre-existing major depression, indirect exposure to disaster trauma through
      family/friends, and disaster-related PTSD. In a final model limited to
      directly-exposed disaster across both databases, postdisaster major depression
      was independently associated with terrorism in addition to the 3 variables that
      predicted postdisaster major depression in the two separate databases.
      Replication of findings from one model to the next across different types of
      disasters and populations in this study suggests that these three variables could
      potentially provide a powerful tool for estimating likelihood of postdisaster
      major depression.

TI  - Who Participates in the Great ShakeOut? Why Audience Segmentation Is the Future
      of Disaster Preparedness Campaigns.
LID - 1407
AB  - Background: In 2008, the Southern California Earthquake Center in collaboration
      with the U.S. Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program launched the first
      annual Great ShakeOut, the largest earthquake preparedness drill in the history
      of the United States. Materials and Methods: We collected online survey data from
      2052 campaign registrants to assess how people participated, whether audience
      segments shared behavioral patterns, and whether these segments were associated
      with five social cognitive factors targeted by the ShakeOut campaign. Results:
      Participants clustered into four behavioral patterns. The Minimal cluster had low
      participation in all activities (range: 0–39% participation). The Basic Drill
      cluster only participated in the drop, cover and hold drill (100% participation).
      The Community-Oriented cluster, involved in the drill (100%) and other
      interpersonal activities including attending disaster planning meetings (74%),
      was positively associated with interpersonal communication (β = 0.169),
      self-efficacy (β = 0.118), outcome efficacy (β = 0.110), and knowledge about
      disaster preparedness (β = 0.151). The Interactive and Games cluster, which
      participated in the drill (79%) and two online earthquake preparedness games (53%
      and 75%), was positively associated with all five social cognitive factors
      studied. Conclusions: Our results support audience segmentation approaches to
      engaging the public, which address the strengths and weaknesses of different
      segments. Offering games may help “gamers” gain competencies required to prepare 
      for disasters. Targeting the highly active Community-Oriented cluster for
      leadership roles could help build community resilience by encouraging others to
      become more involved in disaster planning. We propose that the days of single,
      national education campaigns without local variation should end.

TI  - Examining non-structural retrofitting status of teaching hospitals in Kerman
      against disasters.
PG  - 4434-9
AB  - Background and objective: Continuous services provision of a hospital before and 
      after a disaster is one of the most prominent issues that all people, especially 
      the authorities must take into huge consideration. Concerning the experiences of 
      previous earthquakes, the role and importance of nonstructural components becomes
      increasingly clear in the uninterrupted services of hospitals. In this study,
      non-structural retrofitting status of Kerman teaching hospitals was evaluated
      against natural disasters. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in
      the second half of 2014 on the teaching hospitals in Kerman (Iran). The study
      population consisted of all Kerman teaching hospitals. The research instrument
      was World Health Organization/Pan American Health Organization (WHO/PAHO)
      standard checklist. Data analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics
      through SPSS 19. Results: One hospital had a low retrofitting level, two
      hospitals had an average level and one had a high level. In the examined
      hospitals in this study, the medical gas section had the lowest preparedness
      against natural disasters, while the office, warehouse and furniture section had 
      the highest resistance. Generally, the non-structural retrofitting status was 50%
      in one hospital and was between 65% and 85% in other hospitals. Conclusions:
      Generally, the retrofitting status of hospitals was not at the ideal condition,
      most hospitals were in average condition. Concerning the high risk of hospitals
      in disasters, it is necessary that senior executives and managers of Kerman
      Province and Kerman University of Medical Sciences take some measures to retrofit
      these buildings and to reduce the risk of vulnerability.

TI  - Women’s Challenges and Capabilities in Disasters: A Case Report of the Twin
      Earthquakes of Eastern Azerbaijan, Iran.
LID - ecurrents.dis.2cff3d6e9e0c3a597f873bf29e712370
AB  - Introduction: The twin earthquakes of eastern Azerbaijan induced considerable
      devastations of many villages and cities. About 70% of all victims were women and
      children. The present case report was aimed at describing the lessons learnt from
      both capabilities and challenges of girls and women after the twin earthquakes of
      eastern Azerbaijan.Methods: A qualitative approach using in-depth unstructured
      interviews was used for this study. A total of 13 participants (two men and 11
      women), affected by the quakes, were interviewed applying the purposeful sampling
      method. A manifest content analysis was performed for analyzing the transcribed
      interviewsCase presentation: Two categories of women’s capabilities and
      challenges and four subcategories of women’s participation in community
      reconstruction, livelihood efforts, aggravated poverty and violence were
      extracted from the data which were gathered in the destroyed fields of eastern
      Azerbaijan.Lessons learnt: Women can play an important role in post-disaster
      recovery. Consequently, ignoring the challenges and capabilities of women may
      impede post-disaster development processes, which would adversely affect the
      whole community.

TI  - Needs Assessment for Standardized Educational Program for Iranian Medical
      Students in Crisis and Disaster Management .
PG  - 95-102
AB  - Introduction:: Early education and training are mandatory to raise the knowledge 
      and awareness of the healthcare staff. Iran is a disaster prone area with a high 
      number of emergencies. This study aimed to assess the need for disaster and
      emergency management education for Iranian medical students. Methods:: Using
      two-round Delphi technique in 2017, 15 experts within the field of disaster and
      emergency management were asked for their opinions concerning the education
      required for Iranian medical students. Highly important educational domains and
      their sub-domains selected with an agreement of above 70-80% were prioritized by 
      AHP technique. Results:: Of 41 identified and prioritized educational subjects,
      four main groups were obtained: 1) crisis and disaster primary concepts, 2)
      disease control skills, 3) management skills, and 4) medical care skills. The
      medical care skills had the highest priority (with a weight of 0.546), compared
      to other areas after the final analysis. Conclusion:: Different areas of
      competency are needed to raise awareness and preparedness in medical students in 
      combating crisis and disasters. We propose a curriculum for Iranian medical
      students and suggest it to be used for other professionals, who are involved in
      the process of disaster management.

TI  - Exploring the impact, response and preparedness to water-related natural
      disasters in the Barisal division of Bangladesh: a mixed methods study.
LID - e026459
AB  - Objectives: To investigate the impact of natural disasters on communities in the 
      Barisal division of Bangladesh, exploring community approaches to disaster
      preparedness and mitigation. Setting: Communities in all districts of the Barisal
      division of Bangladesh. Participants: Quantitative data were collected through a 
      cross-sectional household survey (n=9263 households; n=38 981 individuals).
      Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews (n=7) and focus group
      discussions (n=23) with key informants. Outcome measures: Quantitative research
      recorded features of natural disaster events from the previous 5 years,
      documenting risk factors that increase vulnerability to disaster, use of disaster
      warning systems and evacuation processes. Qualitative research investigated
      disaster risk perceptions, experiences during and following disaster, and
      disaster preparedness practices. Results: The survey response rate was 94.7%.
      Exposure to disaster in the last 5 years was high (82%) with flooding and
      cyclones considered the greatest threats. Awareness of evacuation processes was
      low; and only 19% of respondents evacuated their homes at the time of disaster.
      Drowning during disaster was the primary concern (87%), followed by debt,
      livestock and crop loss (78%). The qualitative findings indicated prevailing
      fatalistic perceptions towards natural disasters among community. The
      consequences of disasters included significant loss of livelihoods and exposure
      to infections due to poor sanitation. There was also insufficient support for the
      most vulnerable, particularly women, children and the elderly. Although several
      community preparedness and practices existed, there was a lack of response to
      early warning systems. Barriers to disaster response and resilience included
      financial insecurities, loss of livelihoods and cultural concerns regarding
      women’s privacy. Conclusions: Critical to achieving disaster resilience is
      increased government investment in infrastructure and systems-level responses
      that empower communities. Further research can support this by addressing
      community challenges to promoting disaster resilience and how to leverage
      existing community strengths to implement locally owned solutions.

TI  - Estimation of the National Burden of Disease and Vulnerable Population Associated
      with Natural Disasters in Korea: Heavy Precipitation and Typhoon.
LID - e314
AB  - Background: Despite its growing significance, studies on the burden of disease
      associated with natural disasters from the perspective of public health were few.
      This study aimed at estimating the national burden of disease associated with
      typhoons and torrential rains in Korea. Methods: During the period of 2002–2012, 
      11 typhoons and five torrential rains were selected. Mortality and morbidities
      were defined as accentual death, injury and injury-related infection, and mental 
      health. Their incidences were estimated from National Health Insurance Service.
      Case-crossover design was used to define the disaster-related excess mortality
      and morbidity. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were directly assessed from
      excess mortality and morbidity. Results: The burden of disease from typhoons
      increased with the intensity, with 107.7, 30.6, and 36.6 DALYs per 100,000 per
      event for strong, moderate, and weak typhoons, respectively. Burden of disease
      from torrential rains were 56.9, 52.8, and 26.4 DALYs per 100,000 per event for
      strong, moderate, and weak episodes, respectively. Mental disorders contributed
      more years lived with disability (YLDs) than did injuries in most cases, but the 
      injury-induced YLDs associated with strong typhoon and torrential rain were
      higher than those of lower-intensity. The elderly was the most vulnerable to most
      types of disaster and storm intensities, and males younger than 65 years were
      more vulnerable to a strong torrential rain event. Conclusion: The intensity of
      torrential rain or typhoon was the strongest determinant of the burden of disease
      from natural disasters in Korea. Population vulnerable may vary depending on the 
      nature and strength of the disasters.

TI  - A comparative assessment of major international disasters: the need for exposure 
      assessment, systematic emergency preparedness, and lifetime health care.
LID - 46
AB  - Background: The disasters at Seveso, Three Mile Island, Bhopal, Chernobyl, the
      World Trade Center (WTC) and Fukushima had historic health and economic sequelae 
      for large populations of workers, responders and community members. Methods:
      Comparative data from these events were collected to derive indications for
      future preparedness. Information from the primary sources and a literature review
      addressed: i) exposure assessment; ii) exposed populations; iii) health
      surveillance; iv) follow-up and research outputs; v) observed physical and mental
      health effects; vi) treatment and benefits; and vii) outreach activities.
      Results: Exposure assessment was conducted in Seveso, Chernobyl and Fukushima,
      although none benefited from a timely or systematic strategy, yielding immediate 
      and sequential measurements after the disaster. Identification of exposed
      subjects was overall underestimated. Health surveillance, treatment and follow-up
      research were implemented in Seveso, Chernobyl, Fukushima, and at the WTC, mostly
      focusing on the workers and responders, and to a lesser extent on residents.
      Exposure-related physical and mental health consequences were identified,
      indicating the need for a long-term health care of the affected populations.
      Fukushima has generated the largest scientific output so far, followed by the
      WTCHP and Chernobyl. Benefits programs and active outreach figured prominently in
      only the WTC Health Program. The analysis of these programs yielded the following
      lessons: 1) Know who was there; 2) Have public health input to the disaster
      response; 3) Collect health and needs data rapidly; 4) Take care of the affected;
      5) Emergency preparedness; 6) Data driven, needs assessment, advocacy.
      Conclusions: Given the long-lasting health consequences of natural and man-made
      disasters, health surveillance and treatment programs are critical for management
      of health conditions, and emergency preparedness plans are needed to prevent or
      minimize the impact of future threats.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Negative Emotions in New York City After a
      Natural Disaster as Seen in Social Media.
LID - 2275
AB  - Disasters have substantial consequences for population mental health. We used
      Twitter to (1) extract negative emotions indicating discomfort in New York City
      (NYC) before, during, and after Superstorm Sandy in 2012. We further aimed to (2)
      identify whether pre- or peri-disaster discomfort were associated with peri- or
      post-disaster discomfort, respectively, and to (3) assess geographic variation in
      discomfort across NYC census tracts over time. Our sample consisted of 1,018,140 
      geo-located tweets that were analyzed with an advanced sentiment analysis called 
      ”Extracting the Meaning Of Terse Information in a Visualization of Emotion”
      (EMOTIVE). We calculated discomfort rates for 2137 NYC census tracts, applied
      spatial regimes regression to find associations of discomfort, and used Moran’s I
      for spatial cluster detection across NYC boroughs over time. We found increased
      discomfort, that is, bundled negative emotions after the storm as compared to
      during the storm. Furthermore, pre- and peri-disaster discomfort was positively
      associated with post-disaster discomfort; however, this association was different
      across boroughs, with significant associations only in Manhattan, the Bronx, and 
      Queens. In addition, rates were most prominently spatially clustered in Staten
      Island lasting pre- to post-disaster. This is the first study that determined
      significant associations of negative emotional responses found in social media
      posts over space and time in the context of a natural disaster, which may guide
      us in identifying those areas and populations mostly in need for care.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Using Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation Model
      in Rwanda.
LID - 243
AB  - Landslides susceptibility assessment has to be conducted to identify prone areas 
      and guide risk management. Landslides in Rwanda are very deadly disasters. The
      current research aimed to conduct landslide susceptibility assessment by applying
      Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation Model with eight layers of causal factors
      including: slope, distance to roads, lithology, precipitation, soil texture, soil
      depth, altitude and land cover. In total, 980 past landslide locations were
      mapped. The relationship between landslide factors and inventory map was
      calculated using the Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation. The results revealed that
      susceptibility is spatially distributed countrywide with 42.3% of the region
      classified from moderate to very high susceptibility, and this is inhabited by
      49.3% of the total population. In addition, Provinces with high to very high
      susceptibility are West, North and South (40.4%, 22.8% and 21.5%, respectively). 
      Subsequently, the Eastern Province becomes the peak under low susceptibility
      category (87.8%) with no very high susceptibility (0%). Based on these findings, 
      the employed model produced accurate and reliable outcome in terms of
      susceptibility, since 49.5% of past landslides fell within the very high
      susceptibility category, which confirms the model’s performance. The outcomes of 
      this study will be useful for future initiatives related to landslide risk
      reduction and management.

TI  - Posttraumatic growth and depreciation six years after the 2004 tsunami.
LID - 1302691
AB  - Background: Posttraumatic growth (PTG) has been reported after various types of
      potentially traumatic events, as a part of the personal recovery process among
      survivors. Even negative changes in survivors’ life view, known as posttraumatic 
      depreciation (PTD), have been identified as an additional aspect in the personal 
      recovery processes.Objective: To examine how the type of exposure experienced by 
      survivors of a natural disaster, the 2004 Southeast Asia tsunami, influenced
      self-reported PTG and PTD six years later (T2). Additionally, the study examined 
      the relations between psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms
      (PTSS) 14 months after the disaster (T1), to PTG and PTD, respectively at T2.
      Finally, the study examined whether psychological distress and PTSS (T1) could
      have a mediating effect on PTG and PTD at T2.Method: The participants were 848
      tsunami survivors living in Stockholm, Sweden who responded to a questionnaire at
      14 months (T1) and six years (T2) after the tsunami. The material was analysed
      using linear regression and pathway analysis. PTG and PTD were measured on
      separate scales.Results: The type of exposure was significant related to both PTG
      and PTD six years later (T2). Those experiencing a combination of various types
      of exposure (including threat to life and bereavement) reported higher scores for
      both PTG and PTD. There were significant positive correlations between PTSS at T1
      and PTG /PTD at T2, and somewhat lower correlations between psychological
      distress at T1 and PTG/PTD at T2. Both PTSS and psychological distress at T1 were
      significant mediating variables for both PTG and PTD at T2.Conclusions: Studying 
      survivors’ various types of exposure and subsequent changed view of life – both
      PTG and PTD – resulted in a broadened understanding of the complexity of
      reactions and the recovery process among survivors.

TI  - A novel surveillance approach for disaster mental health.
LID - e0181233
AB  - Background: Disasters have substantial consequences for population mental health.
      Social media data present an opportunity for mental health surveillance after
      disasters to help identify areas of mental health needs. We aimed to 1) identify 
      specific basic emotions from Twitter for the greater New York City area during
      Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall on October 29, 2012, and to 2) detect and
      map spatial temporal clusters representing excess risk of these emotions.
      Methods: We applied an advanced sentiment analysis on 344,957 Twitter tweets in
      the study area over eleven days, from October 22 to November 1, 2012, to extract 
      basic emotions, a space-time scan statistic (SaTScan) and a geographic
      information system (QGIS) to detect and map excess risk of these emotions.
      Results: Sadness and disgust were among the most prominent emotions identified.
      Furthermore, we noted 24 spatial clusters of excess risk of basic emotions over
      time: Four for anger, one for confusion, three for disgust, five for fear, five
      for sadness, and six for surprise. Of these, anger, confusion, disgust and fear
      clusters appeared pre disaster, a cluster of surprise was found peri disaster,
      and a cluster of sadness emerged post disaster. Conclusions: We proposed a novel 
      syndromic surveillance approach for mental health based on social media data that
      may support conventional approaches by providing useful additional information in
      the context of disaster. We showed that excess risk of multiple basic emotions
      could be mapped in space and time as a step towards anticipating acute stress in 
      the population and identifying community mental health need rapidly and
      efficiently in the aftermath of disaster. More studies are needed to better
      control for bias, identify associations with reliable and valid instruments
      measuring mental health, and to explore computational methods for continued
      model-fitting, causal relationships, and ongoing evaluation. Our study may be a
      starting point also for more fully elaborated models that can either
      prospectively detect mental health risk using real-time social media data or
      detect excess risk of emotional reactions in areas that lack efficient
      infrastructure during and after disasters. As such, social media data may be used
      for mental health surveillance after large scale disasters to help identify areas
      of mental health needs and to guide us in our knowledge where we may most
      effectively intervene to reduce the mental health consequences of disasters.

      and Trends in the United States.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - Objectives: To survey advances in public and population health and epidemiology
      informatics over the past 18 months. Methods: We conducted a review of
      English-language research works conducted in the domain of public and population 
      health informatics and published in MEDLINE or Web of Science between January
      2015 and June 2016 where information technology or informatics was a primary
      subject or main component of the study methodology. Selected articles were
      presented using a thematic analysis based on the 2011 American Medical
      Informatics Association (AMIA) Public Health Informatics Agenda tracks as a
      typology. Results: Results are given within the context developed by Dixon et
      al., (2015) and key themes from the 2011 AMIA Public Health Informatics Agenda.
      Advances are presented within a socio-technical infrastructure undergirded by a
      trained, competent public health workforce, systems development to meet the
      business needs of the practice field, and research that evaluates whether those
      needs are adequately met. The ability to support and grow the infrastructure
      depends on financial sustainability. Conclusions: The fields of public health and
      population health informatics continue to grow, with the most notable
      developments focused on surveillance, workforce development, and linking to or
      providing clinical services, which encompassed population health informatics
      advances. Very few advances addressed the need to improve communication,
      coordination, and consistency with the field of informatics itself, as identified
      in the AMIA agenda. This will likely result in the persistence of the silos of
      public health information systems that currently exist. Future research
      activities need to aim toward a holistic approach of informatics across the
      enterprise.

TI  - Assessment of the Casualty Risk of Multiple Meteorological Hazards in China.
LID - 222
AB  - A study of the frequency, intensity, and risk of extreme climatic events or
      natural hazards is important for assessing the impacts of climate change. Many
      models have been developed to assess the risk of multiple hazards, however, most 
      of the existing approaches can only model the relative levels of risk. This paper
      reports the development of a method for the quantitative assessment of the risk
      of multiple hazards based on information diffusion. This method was used to
      assess the risks of loss of human lives from 11 types of meteorological hazards
      in China at the prefectural and provincial levels. Risk curves of multiple
      hazards were obtained for each province and the risks of 10-year, 20-year,
      50-year, and 100-year return periods were mapped. The results show that the
      provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) in southeastern China are at
      higher risk of multiple meteorological hazards as a result of their geographical 
      location and topography. The results of this study can be used as references for 
      the management of meteorological disasters in China. The model can be used to
      quantitatively calculate the risks of casualty, direct economic losses, building 
      collapse, and agricultural losses for any hazards at different spatial scales.

TI  - Tweeting Supertyphoon Haiyan: Evolving Functions of Twitter during and after a
      Disaster Event.
LID - e0150190
AB  - When disaster events capture global attention users of Twitter form transient
      interest communities that disseminate information and other messages online. This
      paper examines content related to Typhoon Haiyan (locally known as Yolanda) as it
      hit the Philippines and triggered international humanitarian response and media
      attention. It reveals how Twitter conversations about disasters evolve over time,
      showing an issue attention cycle on a social media platform. The paper examines
      different functions of Twitter and the information hubs that drive and sustain
      conversation about the event. Content analysis shows that the majority of tweets 
      contain information about the typhoon or its damage, and disaster relief
      activities. There are differences in types of content between the most retweeted 
      messages and posts that are original tweets. Original tweets are more likely to
      come from ordinary users, who are more likely to tweet emotions, messages of
      support, and political content compared with official sources and key information
      hubs that include news organizations, aid organization, and celebrities. Original
      tweets reveal use of the site beyond information to relief coordination and
      response.

TI  - A bibliometric analysis of health-related literature on natural disasters from
      1900 to 2017.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Worldwide, natural disasters have caused a large number of deaths and
      considerable morbidity. Nevertheless, limited information is available on how the
      health-related literature on natural disasters has evolved. The current study
      aims to assess the growth and pattern of health-related literature on natural
      disasters. Method: A bibliometric method was implemented using Scopus database
      for the period from 1900 to 2017. Keywords used in the search strategy were
      obtained from the classifications of natural disasters presented by the Centre
      for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. The health component was
      determined by selecting the health-related subject areas in Scopus. Results: In
      total, 9073 documents were retrieved. The annual number of publications showed a 
      noticeable sharp increase after 2004. The retrieved documents received 97,605
      citations, an average of 10.8 per document. The h-index of the retrieved
      documents was 113. Author keywords with the highest occurrence were ‘earthquakes’
      followed by ‘disaster medicine’, ‘disaster planning’, ‘tsunami’, ‘mental health’,
      ‘disaster preparedness’, ‘PTSD’, ‘emergency preparedness’, and ‘public health’.
      Authors from the United States of America contributed to 3127 (34.5%)
      publications and ranked first, followed by those from Japan (700; 7.7%) and China
      (636; 7.0%). When research output was standardised by Gross Domestic Product per 
      capita, India ranked first, followed by China and the United States. The United
      Kingdom had the highest percentage of documents with international authors,
      followed by those from Switzerland and Canada. The Prehospital and Disaster
      Medicine journal published the most articles (636; 7.0%). The Sichuan University 
      and its affiliated hospital contributed to 384 (7.0%) documents and ranked first 
      in the field. Conclusion: The current baseline information on health-related
      literature on natural disasters showed that this field is growing rapidly but
      with inadequate international research collaboration. Research collaboration in
      this field needs to be strengthened to improve the global response to natural
      disasters in any place in the world. There is a need to expand the research focus
      in this field to include communicable and non-communicable diseases. Finally, the
      health effects of other natural disasters, such as floods, droughts and disease
      outbreaks, need to be addressed. Electronic supplementary material: The online
      version of this article (10.1186/s12961-019-0418-1) contains supplementary

TI  - Untangling the Disaster-Depression Knot: The Role of Social Ties After Deepwater 
      Horizon.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - The mental health consequences of disasters, including oil spills, are well
      known. The goal of this study is to examine whether social capital and social
      support mediate the effects of exposure to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on
      depression among women. Data for the analysis come from the first wave of data
      collection for the Women and Their Children's Health Study, a longitudinal study 
      of the health effects of women exposed to the oil spill in southern Louisiana,
      USA. Women were interviewed about their exposure to the oil spill, depression
      symptoms, structural social capital (neighborhood organization participation),
      cognitive social capital (sense of community and informal social control), and
      social support. Structural equation models indicated that structural social
      capital was associated with increased levels of cognitive social capital, which
      were associated with higher levels of social support, which in turn were
      associated with lower levels of depression. Physical exposure to the oil spill
      was associated with greater economic exposure, which in turn was associated with 
      higher levels of depression. When all variables were taken into account, economic
      exposure was no longer associated with depression, and social support and
      cognitive social capital mediated the effect of economic exposure on depression, 
      explaining 67% of the effect. Findings support an extension of the deterioration 
      model of social support to include the additional coping resource of social
      capital. Social capital and social support were found to be beneficial for
      depression post-oil spill; however, they were themselves negatively impacted by
      the oil spill, explaining the overall negative effect of the oil spill on
      depression. A better understanding of the pathways between the social context and
      depression could lead to interventions for improved mental health in the
      aftermath of a disaster.

TI  - Technology and Information Sharing in Disaster Relief.
LID - e0161783
AB  - This paper seeks to examine the extent to which technological advances can
      enhance inter-organizational information sharing in disaster relief. Our case is 
      the Virtual OSOCC (On-Site Operations Coordination Centre) which is a part of the
      Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) under the United Nations
      Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA). The online platform,
      which has been developing for more than a decade, provides a unique insight into 
      coordination behaviour among disaster management agencies and individual actors. 
      We build our study on the analysis of a complete database of user interaction
      including more than 20,000 users and 11,000 comments spread across approximately 
      300 disaster events. Controlling for types and severities of the events,
      location-specific vulnerabilities, and the overall trends, we find that the
      introduction of new features have led to increases in user activity. We
      supplement the data-driven approach with evidence from semi-structured interviews
      with administrators and key users, as well as a survey among all users
      specifically designed to capture and assess the elements highlighted by both
      interviews and data analysis.

TI  - Role of forensic odontology in the identification of victims of major mass
      disasters across the world: A systematic review.
LID - e0199791
AB  - Background: Forensic odontology (FO) is regarded in the literature as one of the 
      most reliable and economical scientific methods for victim identification in mass
      disasters (MDs). The present paper systematically reviews the role of forensic
      odontologists in various global MDs. Method: A comprehensive search of the
      literature databases (PubMed, Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google
      Scholar), along with cross-referencing published peer-reviewed articles, was
      conducted. The search included full texts, abstracts or titles, had no inclusion 
      year limit (searched until September 2017) and was limited to the English
      language. Keywords included a combination of ‘Forensic odontology’, ‘Dental
      records’, ‘Victim identification’, ‘Natural mass disaster’, ‘Criminal mass
      disaster’, ‘Accidental mass disaster’ and ‘Victim disaster’. Results: Of the
      included disasters (20), 12 (57.14%) were accidental, 5 (23.80%) natural and 3
      (19.04%) were criminal. The maximum number of victims was associated with the
      Japan tsunami (15892), followed by the Thailand tsunami (4280) and the Estonia
      ferry disaster (852). A total of 23654 victims were reported, of which 20569
      (86.96%) were positively identified. Reports from 17 MDs included the use of FO
      in victim identification [3025 (14.70%) cases]. In addition, 1094 victims (5.31%;
      from 7 papers) were identified using FO in combination with other methodologies. 
      The highest percentage of victims was identified using FO following the Kentucky 
      air crash (47; 100%), followed by the Newark air crash (38; 76%), the Nepal air
      crash (10; 71.42%), the France air crash (56; 65.88%), the Australian bushfire
      (14; 63.63%), and the Estonia ferry disaster (57; 60.63%). Conclusion: FO has
      played a significant role in victim identification in several MDs around the
      world. The success of FO-based identification is heavily dependent on the
      availability of ante-mortem records from general dental practitioners. Hence,
      adequate knowledge about FO and appropriate dental record keeping among general
      dental practitioners are critical.

      Schools and Colleges.
LID - 6332
AB  - Objective. To characterize informatics education opportunities in US colleges and
      schools of pharmacy curricula.Methods. Informatics curricular information online 
      was catalogued via publicly available websites. Website content was searched via 
      domain-specific keywords. Online course descriptions were reviewed. Website
      searches were also conducted for informatics-related opportunities.Results. Of
      132 pharmacy curricula found online, 47 (36%) included an informatics course. Of 
      those, 64% (n=30) were required while 47% (n=22) were elective courses.
      Additionally, 20% (n=26) provided informatics advanced and/or introductory
      pharmacy practice experiences, 20% (n=27) offered an informatics residency, and
      17% (n=22) listed certificate and/or graduate degree programs in
      informatics.Conclusion. Over the past 10 years, little observable progress has
      been made in pharmacy school curricula in response to the increasing importance
      of informatics to the profession. Pharmacy programs can address this educational 
      gap by internal (eg, course development) and external (eg, open source
      curriculum) solutions.

TI  - Humanitarian governance and resilience building: Ethiopia in comparative
      perspective.
PG  - S109-31
AB  - Humanitarian governance is usually understood according to the classic, Dunantist
      paradigm that accords central importance to international humanitarian agencies. 
      However, this is increasingly paralleled by ‘resilience humanitarianism’ that
      focuses, among other things, on including national actors in humanitarian
      governance. This article views humanitarian governance as emerging through
      interactions between authorities, implementing agencies and communities. It is
      based on interactive ethnography in five countries by Partners for Resilience
      (PfR). Using the Theory of Change (ToC) tool, it analyses the various
      interpretations and priorities of actors involved in humanitarian problems,
      solutions and programme governance. For example, PfR had a ‘software’ focus,
      aiming to unlock communities’ potential for resilience, whereas communities and
      authorities preferred to receive tangible ‘hardware’ support. The findings
      highlight the crucial role of local authorities in shaping humanitarian aid. This
      is especially pertinent in view of the international agenda to localise aid,
      which requires the understanding and support of national actors in order to
      responsibly protect the vulnerable.

TI  - The UCL–Lancet Commission on Migration and Health: the health of a world on the
      move.
PG  - 2606-54
AB  - With one billion people on the move or having moved in 2018, migration is a
      global reality, which has also become a political lightning rod. Although
      estimates indicate that the majority of global migration occurs within low-income
      and middle-income countries (LMICs), the most prominent dialogue focuses almost
      exclusively on migration from LMICs to high-income countries (HICs). Nowadays,
      populist discourse demonises the very same individuals who uphold economies,
      bolster social services, and contribute to health services in both origin and
      destination locations. Those in positions of political and economic power
      continue to restrict or publicly condemn migration to promote their own
      interests. Meanwhile nationalist movements assert so-called cultural sovereignty 
      by delineating an us versus them rhetoric, creating a moral emergency.In response
      to these issues, the UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health was convened
      to articulate evidence-based approaches to inform public discourse and policy.
      The Commission undertook analyses and consulted widely, with diverse
      international evidence and expertise spanning sociology, politics, public health 
      science, law, humanitarianism, and anthropology. The result of this work is a
      report that aims to be a call to action for civil society, health leaders,
      academics, and policy makers to maximise the benefits and reduce the costs of
      migration on health locally and globally. The outputs of our work relate to five 
      overarching goals that we thread throughout the report.First, we provide the
      latest evidence on migration and health outcomes. This evidence challenges common
      myths and highlights the diversity, dynamics, and benefits of modern migration
      and how it relates to population and individual health. Migrants generally
      contribute more to the wealth of host societies than they cost. Our Article shows
      that international migrants in HICs have, on average, lower mortality than the
      host country population. However, increased morbidity was found for some
      conditions and among certain subgroups of migrants, (eg, increased rates of
      mental illness in victims of trafficking and people fleeing conflict) and in
      populations left behind in the location of origin. Currently, in 2018, the full
      range of migrants’ health needs are difficult to assess because of poor quality
      data. We know very little, for example, about the health of undocumented
      migrants, people with disabilities, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, or
      intersex (LGBTI) individuals who migrate or who are unable to move.Second, we
      examine multisector determinants of health and consider the implication of the
      current sector-siloed approaches. The health of people who migrate depends
      greatly on structural and political factors that determine the impetus for
      migration, the conditions of their journey, and their destination.
      Discrimination, gender inequalities, and exclusion from health and social
      services repeatedly emerge as negative health influences for migrants that
      require cross-sector responses.Third, we critically review key challenges to
      healthy migration. Population mobility provides economic, social, and cultural
      dividends for those who migrate and their host communities. Furthermore, the
      right to the highest attainable standard of health, regardless of location or
      migration status, is enshrined in numerous human rights instruments. However,
      national sovereignty concerns overshadow these benefits and legal norms.
      Attention to migration focuses largely on security concerns. When there is
      conjoining of the words health and migration, it is either focused on small
      subsets of society and policy, or negatively construed. International agreements,
      such as the UN Global Compact for Migration and the UN Global Compact on
      Refugees, represent an opportunity to ensure that international solidarity, unity
      of intent, and our shared humanity triumphs over nationalist and exclusionary
      policies, leading to concrete actions to protect the health of migrants.Fourth,
      we examine equity in access to health and health services and offer
      evidence-based solutions to improve the health of migrants. Migrants should be
      explicitly included in universal health coverage commitments. Ultimately, the
      cost of failing to be health-inclusive could be more expensive to national
      economies, health security, and global health than the modest investments
      required.Finally, we look ahead to outline how our evidence can contribute to
      synergistic and equitable health, social, and economic policies, and feasible
      strategies to inform and inspire action by migrants, policy makers, and civil
      society. We conclude that migration should be treated as a central feature of
      21st century health and development. Commitments to the health of migrating
      populations should be considered across all Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
      and in the implementation of the Global Compact for Migration and Global Compact 
      on Refugees. This Commission offers recommendations that view population mobility
      as an asset to global health by showing the meaning and reality of good health
      for all. We present four key messages that provide a focus for future action.

TI  - Stable Iodine Distribution Among Children After the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear
      Disaster in Japan: An Observational Study.
PG  - 1658-66
AB  - Context: Intake of stable iodine helps prevent childhood thyroid cancer in
      nuclear emergencies, but there is limited case information. Objective: We
      identified the intake rate and the factors associated with no intake among
      children who did not take stable iodine after the Fukushima disaster. Design:
      Retrospective observational study. Setting: Data were obtained from thyroid
      cancer screenings performed from August through November 2017. Participants:
      Children in Miharu Town, Fukushima, Japan. Intervention: No intervention. Main
      Outcome Measures: We performed multilevel logistic regression analysis at the
      regional and individual levels. We qualitatively examined the reasons for no
      intake of stable iodine based on closed- and open-ended questions. Results: The
      rate of distribution was 94.9%, but the intake rate was only 63.5%. Intake was
      lower in those aged 0 to 2 years compared with those aged ≥3 years (OR, 0.21; 95%
      CI, 0.11 to 0.36). Parents’ intake was positively associated with their
      children’s intake (OR, 61.0; 95% CI, 37.9 to 102.9). The variance partition
      coefficient for regions was 0.021, suggesting that the intake of stable iodine
      was more likely affected by individual than by regional factors. Closed-ended
      questions showed that the main reason for avoiding intake was concern about
      safety. Open-ended questions for other reasons revealed issues related to the
      distribution method, information about the effects and adverse effects of iodine,
      and instructions for iodine intake. There were no symptomatic adverse effects
      claimed to the town. Conclusions: The distribution and consumption of stable
      iodine occurred in Miharu Town after the Fukushima disaster. To prepare for
      future nuclear emergencies, it is important to explain to both children and
      parents the need for intake of stable iodine, particularly among young children.

TI  - A systems approach to natural disaster resilience.
PG  - 11-31
AB  - The frequency, social, and economic impacts of natural disasters show exponential
      increases in recent decades. Cities and countries around the world have begun to 
      realize that these events are no longer “hundred year” storms, but repeat within 
      a few years. As urbanisation continues throughout this century, more and more
      people and more economic activity will be concentrated in at-risk areas;
      especially as new arrivals in cities throughout Asia and Africa are likely to be 
      concentrated in the highest risk districts, much as they often are in North
      America and Europe today. This article reviews recent growth of natural disasters
      and considers how a systems approach can improve approaches to mitigation and
      adaptation of these risks and to recovery from such events.

TI  - Disaster Medicine in Taiwan.
PG  - 83-109
AB  - This study aimed to examine scientific publications that were related to disaster
      medicine and were authored by emergency medicine physicians in Taiwan. This
      descriptive study utilized the electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of
      Science. Academic works that were published between January 1, 1999, and December
      31, 2018, were collected for review and analysis. Of the 53 articles included in 
      the final analysis,40 (75.5%) were original research, 3 (5.7%) were reviews, 1
      (1.9%) was a brief report, and 9 (17.0%) were perspectives. The top 5 themes were
      disaster response systems (17, 32.1%), endemic diseases (11, 20.8%), emergency
      department (ED) overcrowding (10, 18.9%), earthquakes (10, 18.9%), and ED
      administration (9, 17.0%). Sixteen (30.2%) articles involved international
      collaborations. The median, interquartile range and range of the numbers of
      citations of the articles were 3, 1–11, and 0–65, respectively. Twenty-four
      (45.3%) articles were related to specific incidents: the Chi-Chi earthquake in
      1999 (n = 5), the Singapore airline crash in 2000 (n = 1), Typhoon Nari in 2001
      (n = 1), the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 (n = 7),
      Typhoon Morakot in 2009 (n = 1), the color party explosion in Formosa Fun Coast
      Park in 2015 (n = 4), and the Tainan earthquake in 2016 (n = 5). Regarding the
      study methods, 19 (35.8%) articles were quantitative studies; 10 (18.9%) were
      qualitative or semiqualitative studies; 8 (15.1%) used questionnaire surveys; 3
      (5.7%) were literature reviews; 3 (5.7%) used computer simulations; and 10
      (18.9%) were descriptive/narrative or other types of studies. Though the number
      of academic publications related to disaster medicine from the EDs in Taiwan is
      relatively limited, the quality and diversity of research seem promising. The
      research environment and education programs on disaster medicine in Taiwan
      deserve thoughtful consideration.

TI  - The Need for a Definition of Big Data for Nursing Science: A Case Study of
      Disaster Preparedness.
LID - 1015
AB  - The rapid development of technology has made enormous volumes of data available
      and achievable anytime and anywhere around the world. Data scientists call this
      change a data era and have introduced the term “Big Data”, which has drawn the
      attention of nursing scholars. Nevertheless, the concept of Big Data is quite
      fuzzy and there is no agreement on its definition among researchers of different 
      disciplines. Without a clear consensus on this issue, nursing scholars who are
      relatively new to the concept may consider Big Data to be merely a dataset of a
      bigger size. Having a suitable definition for nurse researchers in their context 
      of research and practice is essential for the advancement of nursing research. In
      view of the need for a better understanding on what Big Data is, the aim in this 
      paper is to explore and discuss the concept. Furthermore, an example of a Big
      Data research study on disaster nursing preparedness involving six million
      patient records is used for discussion. The example demonstrates that a Big Data 
      analysis can be conducted from many more perspectives than would be possible in
      traditional sampling, and is superior to traditional sampling. Experience gained 
      from the process of using Big Data in this study will shed light on future
      opportunities for conducting evidence-based nursing research to achieve
      competence in disaster nursing.

TI  - Interjurisdictional Variance in US Workers’ Benefits for Emergency Response
      Volunteers.
PG  - S387-93
AB  - Volunteers who are deployed during times of disaster are critical public health
      system assets. These individuals share concerns about a variety of subjects with 
      public health law implications, including whether they are entitled to employment
      benefits before, during, and after disaster response.We examined and analyzed
      state employment benefit laws pertaining to emergency response volunteers. We
      used the Emergency Law Inventory (ELI; https://legalinventory.pitt.edu)—an
      informatics tool developed at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of
      Public Health that contains more than 1300 statutory and regulatory provisions
      affecting volunteer activities—to access certain employment laws in 60
      jurisdictions.Analyses of the laws revealed that fewer than half of the
      jurisdictions have laws that protect seniority, vacation time, sick time, or
      overtime privileges. Additionally, there is tremendous variance and lack of
      uniformity among the jurisdictions concerning employment status requirements,
      geographic constraints, time limitations, and economic impacts. Major disasters
      often necessitate interjurisdictional response. To facilitate effective
      deployment of volunteers, employment laws should be uniform across the states.
      Furthermore, limitations that impede volunteer responders should be eliminated.

TI  - Assessing the resilience of stochastic dynamic systems under partial
      observability.
LID - e0202337
AB  - Resilience is a property of major interest for the design and analysis of generic
      complex systems. A system is resilient if it can adjust in response to disruptive
      shocks, and still provide the services it was designed for, without
      interruptions. In this work, we adapt a formal definition of resilience for
      constraint-based systems to a probabilistic framework derived from hidden Markov 
      models. This allows us to more realistically model the stochastic evolution and
      partial observability of many complex real-world environments. Within this
      framework, we propose an efficient and exact algorithm for the inference queries 
      required to construct generic property checking. We show that the time complexity
      of this algorithm is on par with other state-of-the-art inference queries for
      similar frameworks (that is, linear with respect to the time horizon). We also
      provide considerations on the specific complexity of the probabilistic checking
      of resilience and its connected properties, with particular focus on resistance. 
      To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach and to evaluate its performance,
      we examine it in four qualitative and quantitative example scenarios: (1)
      disaster management and damage assessment; (2) macroeconomics; (3) self-aware,
      reconfigurable computing for aerospace applications; and (4) connectivity
      maintenance in robotic swarms.

      Ethiopia.
LID - 2212
AB  - Despite the intuitive connection between drought and mortality, we still lack a
      sound quantitative synthesis of evidence drawn from the available data. In this
      study, we estimate the pooled under-five death rates (U5DR) and assess the effect
      of drought on child death in Ethiopia. Small-scale mortality surveys were
      searched from the Complex Emergency Database and then aggregated spatially and
      temporally with drought exposure data from the Global Drought Monitor and food
      insecurity data from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network. A Bayesian Poisson
      meta-analysis was performed on 88 surveys conducted in Ethiopia between 2009 and 
      2014, consisting of 55,219 under-five children. The pooled U5DR was estimated at 
      0.323/10,000/day (95% credible interval, CrI: 0.254–0.397), which is below
      both the emergency and the baseline death rate thresholds of sub-Saharan Africa. 
      We failed to find a plausible association between drought and U5DR. However,
      minimal food insecure areas showed elevated U5DR compared to stressed food
      insecure areas. Furthermore, the U5DR increases as the prevalence of acute
      malnutrition increases. Targeted interventions to improve the underlying causes
      of child malnutrition are crucial. Further, revising and updating the existing
      mortality thresholds, both the baseline and the emergency, is recommended.

TI  - Developing a Model for Hospitals’ Emergency Department Preparedness in Radiation 
      and Nuclear Incidents and Nuclear Terrorism in Iran.
PG  - 300-6
AB  - Objective:: To develop a national model for hospitals’ Emergency Department (ED) 
      preparedness when facing radiation and nuclear incidents as well as nuclear
      terrorism in Iran. Methods:: This analytical study was carried out in 2019 via
      Delphi technique in two rounds and prioritization using a pairwise questionnaire.
      Using classic Delphi technique and pairwise comparison, the components were given
      to 32 specialists in emergency medicine, nuclear medicine, medical physics,
      nuclear physics, radiobiology and radiation protection, health in disaster and
      emergency, and passive defense. Finally, the national model was developed by
      holding two focus group sessions. Results:: The results from the two rounds of
      Delphi technique showed that 31 factors of preparedness were classified into
      three main classes, namely staff, stuff, and structure (system). Only three
      factors were excluded and the rest were agreed upon by the specialists. Given the
      weight of each class, it was found that staff preparedness and stuff preparedness
      had the highest and lowest priorities, respectively. Conclusion:: Comprehensive
      preparedness requires enhancing and promoting cultural, social, economic, and
      political levels. Indeed, all preparedness levels should be promoted in alignment
      with each other. Hence, governments should align their policies to manage such
      incidents.

TI  - Health Consequences of an Armed Conflict in Zamboanga, Philippines Using a
      Syndromic Surveillance Database.
LID - 2690
AB  - The Zamboanga armed conflict was a 19-day long encounter in the Philippines in
      2013 that displaced 119,000 people from their homes. This study describes the
      health consequences of this complex emergency in different age groups, time
      periods, and health facilities using data from Surveillance in Post Extreme
      Emergencies and Disasters (SPEED). This is a descriptive study of the SPEED
      database spanning 196 days of observation post-disaster and 1065 SPEED reports
      from 49 health facilities. Evacuation centers and village health centers, both
      primary care facilities, had the highest number of consults. Common infections
      and noncommunicable diseases were the most common reasons for consultations,
      namely, acute respiratory infections, fever, watery diarrhea, skin disease, and
      hypertension. Infections can be associated with environmental conditions in
      displaced populations, while hypertension has a high prevalence in the country
      and implies long-term care. Conflict-related injuries and deaths were not
      frequently observed due to the volatile situation that influenced health-seeking 
      behavior as well as possible reporting gaps. In conclusion, in complex
      emergencies, as in natural disasters, wherein early alert and warning for
      potential outbreaks is crucial, SPEED can assist decision makers on response and 
      recovery interventions. Linkages between SPEED and other surveillance and
      reporting systems need to be explored.

TI  - Change of access to emergency care in a repopulated village after the 2011
      Fukushima nuclear disaster: a retrospective observational study.
LID - e023836
AB  - Objectives: Sustaining emergency care access is of great concern. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate access to emergency care in a repopulated village following 
      the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Design: This research was a retrospective
      observational study. The primary outcome measure was total emergency medical
      services (EMS) time. A Bayesian time series analysis was performed to consider
      local time series trend and seasonality. Setting: The residents in Kawauchi
      Village, Fukushima, Japan were forced to evacuate after the 2011 Fukushima
      disaster. As the radiation dose was an acceptable level, the residents began the 
      process of repopulation in April 2012. Participants: This study included patients
      transported by EMS from January 2009 to October 2015. Patients transported during
      the evacuation period (from March 2011 to March 2012) were excluded. Results: A
      total of 781 patients were transferred by EMS (281 patients before the disaster, 
      416 after repopulation and 84 during the evacuation period). A Bayesian time
      series analysis revealed an increase in total EMS time, from the first request
      call to arrival at a hospital of 21.85 min (95% credible interval 14.2–29.0,
      Bayesian one-sided tail-area probability p=0.001). After the disaster, 42.3% of
      patients were transported to a partner hospital. Conclusions: Total EMS time
      increased after repopulation of the area affected because of a massive number of 
      hospital closures. Proactive partnerships would be a possible countermeasure in
      the affected areas after a major disaster.

TI  - An Emergency Response System: Construction, Validation, and Experiments for
      Disaster Management in a Vehicular Environment.
LID - 1150
AB  - Natural disasters and catastrophes not only cost the loss of human lives, but
      adversely affect the progress toward sustainable development of the country. As
      soon as disaster strikes, the first and foremost challenge for the concerned
      authorities is to make an expeditious response. Consequently, they need to be
      highly-organized, properly-trained, and sufficiently-equipped to effectively
      respond and limit the destructive effects of a disaster. In such circumstances,
      communication plays a vital role, whereby the consequences of tasks assigned to
      the workers for rescue and relief services may be streamlined by relaying
      necessary information among themselves. Moreover, most of the infrastructure is
      either severely damaged or completely destroyed in post-disaster scenarios;
      therefore, a Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is used to carry out the rescue
      operation, as it does not require any pre-existing infrastructure. In this
      context, the current work proposes and validates an effective way to relay the
      crucial information through the development of an application and the deployment 
      of an experimental TestBed in a vehicular environment. The TestBed may able to
      provide a way to design and validate the algorithms. It provides a number of
      vehicles with onboard units embedded with a credit-card-size microcomputer called
      Raspberry Pi and a Global Positioning System (GPS) module. Additionally, it
      dispatches one of the pre-defined codes of emergency messages based on the level 
      of urgency through multiple hops to a central control room. Depending on the
      message code received from a client, the server takes appropriate action.
      Furthermore, the solution also provides a graphical interface that is easy to
      interpret and to understand at the control room to visualize the rescue operation
      on the fly.

TI  - Urban Resources Selection and Allocation for Emergency Shelters: In a
      Multi-Hazard Environment.
LID - 1261
AB  - This study explores how emergency shelters can adapt to a multi-hazard
      environment by geographic information system (GIS) and takes Guangzhou as a case 
      for analysis. The physical suitability of the overall urban resources was first
      assessed by aiming to select the suitable resources and safe locations for
      emergency shelters in the context of multiple disasters. Afterward, by analyzing 
      the scale and spatial distribution of affected areas and populations under
      different types of disaster scenarios, the demand for different kinds of shelters
      were predicted. Lastly, taking into account the coverage of the affected people, 
      shelters were allocated according to different conditions in the districts. This 
      work will hopefully provide a reference for the construction of emergency
      shelters and help form emergency operations in order to mitigate the impact of
      hazards. The issues identified in the study need to be further studied in medium 
      or small-scale cities.

TI  - Vulnerability of cotton subjected to hail damage.
LID - e0210787
AB  - This paper establishes the quantitative relationships between hail fall
      parameters and crop damages by examining the impacts of 49 hail hazard scenarios 
      on cotton in the bud stage and boll stage. This study utilizes simulated cotton
      hail hazard to analyze the following data: hail size, hail fall density, and crop
      damages (i.e., defoliation rate, branch breaking rate, and the fruit falling
      rate). The results are as follows: 1) cotton vulnerability increased via an
      increase in crop damages as the hail hazard magnitude increased; 2) crop damages 
      exhibit significant logistic relationships with hail diameter and hail fall
      density, and the fit was better at the bud stage than at the boll stage; 3)
      cotton is more vulnerable to hail hazard at the bud stage than at the boll stage,
      and the bud stage is a critical period for cotton hail disaster prevention and
      mitigation; and 4) damages to cotton plant at the bud stage and boll stage were
      less sensitive to hail size from hail fall density. Thus, we suggest that hail
      diameter can be used as the priority indicator to predict hail-induced crop
      damages. These results provide a sound basis for developing a comprehensive
      evaluation of hail damage in cotton, which is crucial for promoting sustainable
      cotton production. We recommend that the impacts of hail-induced crop damages on 
      yield and fiber quality need to be addressed further in future studies.

      agents. Materials and Methods: During a 3-year time frame, the research team and 
      partners developed the Emergency Department Informatics Computational Tool and
      planned a functional exercise to test it using medical records data from 298
      patients seen in 1 emergency department following a chlorine gas exposure in
      2005. Results: The research team learned valuable lessons throughout the planning
      process that will assist future researchers with developing a functional exercise
      to test informatics tools. Key considerations for a functional exercise include
      contributors, venue, and information technology needs (ie, hardware, software,
      and data collection methods). Discussion: Due to the nature of mass casualty
      incidents, testing informatics tools and technology for these incidents is
      challenging. Previous studies have shown a functional exercise as a viable option
      to test informatics tools developed for use during mass casualty incidents.
      Conclusion: Utilizing a functional exercise to test new mass casualty management 
      technology and informatics tools involves a painstaking and complex planning
      process; however, it does allow researchers to address issues inherent in
      studying informatics tools for mas casualty incidents.

TI  - Promoting Community Preparedness and Resilience: A Latino Immigrant
      Community–Driven Project Following Hurricane Sandy.
PG  - S161-4
AB  - As community residents and recovery workers, Latino immigrants play important
      roles after disasters, yet are rarely included in preparedness planning. A
      community–university–labor union partnership created a demonstration project
      after Hurricane Sandy to strengthen connections to disaster preparedness systems 
      to increase community resilience among Latino immigrant communities in New York
      and New Jersey. Building ongoing ties that connect workers and community-based
      organizations with local disaster preparedness systems provided mutual benefits
      to disaster planners and local immigrant communities, and also had an impact on
      national disaster-related initiatives.

TI  - An Overview of the Strengths and Challenges Related to Health on the First 10
      Days after the Large Earthquake in the West of Iran, 2017.
PG  - 963-70
AB  - Background:: The objective of the present study was to investigate the strength
      and weaknesses of healthcare management during the first 10 days after the
      earthquake in Sarpol-e Zahab in Kermanshah, Iran. Methods:: This qualitative,
      observational study was conducted on November 13–23, 2017 in the disaster area,
      by using content analysis. Data was collected through experts and focus group
      interviews with professional and healthcare staff, and policy-makers. Results::
      Our findings were categorized into 7 major groups; environmental health; mental
      health; mothers, infants and children’s health; field hospital; nutrition;
      contagious diseases; drug delivery. There were good cooperation and coordination 
      regarding environmental health issues. However, other categories were handled by 
      different organizations and resulted in a chaotic situation. Conclusion:: The
      post-earthquake period is overwhelmed with considerable issues regarding the care
      of victims and therapeutic measures. Lack of quick, reliable, and appropriate
      management will result in extensive health issues, including epidemic, worsening 
      of chronic diseases, and exacerbation of mental disorders.

TI  - Diagnoses, infections and injuries in Northern Syrian children during the civil
      war: A cross-sectional study.
LID - e0182770
AB  - Background: The civil war in Syria including the deliberate targeting of
      healthcare services resulted in a complex humanitarian emergency, seriously
      affecting children's health. The objectives of this study are to document
      diagnoses and disease categories in Northern Syrian children after four years of 
      conflict, and to document infectious diseases and injuries in this vulnerable
      population. Methods: In a prospective cross-sectional observational sample study 
      conducted in May 2015, healthcare workers registered demographics, comorbidities,
      and diagnoses (categorised according to the International Classification of
      Diseases version 10) in children visited at home and in internally displaced
      persons camps in four Syrian governorates. Results: Of 1080 filled-out records,
      1002 were included. Children originated from Aleppo (41%), Idleb (36%), Hamah
      (15%) and Lattakia (8%). Median age was 6 years (0–15; IQR 3–11), 61% were boys, 
      40% were younger than 5 years old. Children suffered from respiratory (29%),
      neurological (19%), digestive (17%), eye (5%) and skin (5%) diseases. Clinical
      malnutrition was seen in 4%, accidental injury in 3%, intentional injury in 1%,
      and mental disorders in 2%. Overall, 64% had features of infectious diseases (OR 
      0.635; CI 0.605–0.665). Most common comorbidities were chronic respiratory
      diseases (14, malnutrition (5%), acute flaccid paralysis (5%), and epilepsy (4%).
      Logistic regression analysis indicated that the risk for children to have
      communicable diseases was higher in Aleppo than in Idleb (OR 1.7; CI 1.2–2.3),
      Hamah (OR 4.9; CI 3.3–7.5), or Lattakia (OR 5.5; CI 3.3–9.3). Children in Aleppo 
      and Lattakia were more at risk to be injured than in Idleb (OR 5.6; CI 2.1–14.3),
      or in Hamah (OR 5.9; CI 1.4–25.6), but more often from intentional violence in
      Lattakia. Mental problems were more prominent in Hamah. Conclusions: Four years
      far in the conflict, 64% of the studied children in four Northern Syrian
      governorates suffer from infections, mostly from respiratory, neurological and
      digestive origin, while 4% was injured or victim of intentional aggression.
      Substandard living conditions and the lack of paediatric healthcare put Syrian
      children at risk for serious infections, epidemics and morbidity, and ask for
      urgent international humanitarian relief efforts.

TI  - Design of Temperature Insurance Index and Risk Zonation for Single-Season Rice in
      Response to High-Temperature and Low-Temperature Damage: A Case Study of Jiangsu 
      Province, China.
LID - 1187
AB  - Disaster insurance is an important tool for achieving sustainable development in 
      modern agriculture. However, in China, the design of such insurance indexes is
      far from sufficient. In this paper, the single-season rice in Jiangsu Province of
      China is taken as an example to design the high-temperature damage index in
      summer and the low-temperature damage index in autumn to construct the formula
      calculating the weather output and single-season rice yield reduction. The daily 
      highest, lowest and average temperatures between 1999 and 2015 are selected as
      main variables for the temperature disaster index to quantitatively analyze the
      relationship between the temperature index and the yield reduction rate of the
      single-season rice. The temperature disaster index can be put into the relevant
      model to obtain the yield reduction rate of the year and determine whether to pay
      the indemnity. Then, the burn analysis is used to determine the insurance premium
      rate for all cities in Jiangsu Province under four-level deductibles, and the
      insurance premium rate can be used for the risk division of the Province. The
      research provides some insights for the design of agricultural weather insurance 
      products, and the empirical results provide a reference for the design of similar
      single-season rice temperature index insurance products.
